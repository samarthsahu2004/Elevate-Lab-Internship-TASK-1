**Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Machine Learning**
This repository contains a Python script for cleaning, preprocessing, and preparing the classic Titanic dataset for machine learning tasks. The goal is to transform the raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for model training.
Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate a standard workflow for data preprocessing, which is a crucial first step in any machine learning pipeline. This includes handling missing data, converting data types, normalizing features, and managing outliers.
Dataset
The project uses the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, which is widely used for introducing machine learning concepts.
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
File: Titanic-Dataset.csv
The dataset provides information on passengers of the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, along with features like age, class, sex, and fare.
Tools and Libraries
Python 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For feature scaling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization, specifically for identifying outliers.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Workflow
The Python script (clean_titanic.py) performs the following steps:
Load and Explore Data:
The Titanic-Dataset.csv is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Initial exploration is done using .info() and .head() to understand data types, non-null counts, and the overall structure.
Handle Missing Values:
Age: Missing age values are imputed using the median age of all passengers.
Embarked: Missing port of embarkation values are filled with the mode (the most frequent port).
Cabin: The 'Cabin' column is dropped from the dataset due to a high number of missing values.
Encode Categorical Features:
The Sex and Embarked columns, which are categorical, are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding with pd.get_dummies(). This is necessary for most machine learning algorithms.
Standardize Numerical Features:
The Age and Fare columns are standardized using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. This scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the model.
Visualize and Remove Outliers:
Boxplots are generated for the Age and Fare columns to visually identify outliers.
Outliers are then programmatically removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Any data point that falls outside of 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile or above the third quartile is considered an outlier and removed.
